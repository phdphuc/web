What is SafeFinder/OperatorMac campaign?
========================================

A new variant of adware was just discovered yesterday. It‚Äôs going viral on Twitter and other media, since they use valid Apple developer certificate to sign all packed samples. I‚Äôm quite overbusy these days but it got my interest when seeing the name stated in that certificate: ‚ÄúQuoc Thinh‚Äù, quite a unique Vietnamese name. So why not take a break from desperate thesis, toss adware in my lame automated MacOS analysis framework and see what our ‚Äòcountryman‚Äô doing?

The sample was first noticed by _Gavriel State_‚Äè on Aug 7, then _Thomas A Reed_ ‚Äì the Mac malware boss hunter from Malwarebytes - confirmed it relates to OperatorMac on the next day. I think you all know the famous Mac free security tools‚Äô author: _Patrick Wardle_, wrote an amazing report on [objective-see.com](https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x20.html) in Aug 9. So I‚Äôm not going too deep in reverse engineering - static analysis, just throw in my Grey-cuckoo framework and grab results. In case somebody doesn‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs my thesis project and and soon to be released right after my judgment day - defense (hopefully).

From Patrick‚Äôs report we understand it‚Äôs an adware which installs lots of crabs. By default, cuckoo sandbox timeout is 120 sec. Let‚Äôs extend it a bit, 300 sec (5 min) would be enough.

First result we got, that Apple developer ID ‚ÄúQuoc Thinh‚Äù, and he got his certificate revoked from Apple today by the way üòÑ.

`spctl -avv "Mughthesec-Player(dmg).dmg"   Mughthesec-Player(dmg).dmg: **CSSMERR_TP_CERT_REVOKED**`

From captured screenshots, we can see what this adware apparently executes: Install Adobe flash and offer you a bunch of PUA (potential unwanted applications) ‚Äì Booking, Advanced Mac Cleaner, SafeFinder Safari extension, and AdBlock (in some relevant samples that will be discussed later).

Behavioral analysis shows the packed DMG sample invoked a ‚Äòmac‚Äô binary, thereafter ‚ÄòMughthesec‚Äô with a persistence ‚ÄòI‚Äô binary. Screenshots below already included other analysis variant of this campaign.

Move on to the network DNS feature, we see a lot of queries and some domains look "suspicious". Their DNS servers mostly are pointed to Akamai so I suggest we rather use domain as IOC than IP address, which could be different from viewers location. Filtering system calls logs with some rules of mine, there is no evasion technique been found. It‚Äôs quite surprising because Virustotal behavioral analysis shows a shorter execution trace than mine, which usually means its environment was detected at some point and malware stop running. In Patrick‚Äôs report he said there might be MAC address verification to detect VM (VM MAC usually starts with ‚Äô00:xx‚Äô). Fortunately, my VM framework MAC address was modified long ago since my colleague Yorick Koster at Securify used same trick to abuse my lame framework (thanks Yorick). I should add new rule ‚Äì ‚ÄúMAC address check‚Äù later.

Additionally instead of execve(), MacOS sandbox policy usually invokes processes using XPCProxy or launchd services. So we got several processes created with posix\_spawn(): delete Safari, iBooks, Mail cache (likely Advanced Mac cleaner doing its job), install mentioned PUAs and we got some new IOCs.

Other great things from Cuckoo sandbox are Network analysis and Dropped files. However previous report detailed it well enough, hence only some screenshots from these features will be showed:

Some dropped binaries like AMCleaner (93dd0c34a4ec25a508cd6d5fb86d8ccc0c318238d9fee0c93342a20759bf9b7e) already marked as malicious on VirusTotal (VT) 7/56, which could be an indication for vigilant users.

Also with some fancy nonsense statistic screenshots, intent to scare analyst (:p)

At this moment, we have got all indicators to make behavioral detection rule and go hunting for other similar adware samples. Reason why I call this blog post ‚Äì ‚Äúa campaign‚Äù: there are numerous similar packed DMG/Mac apps matched ‚Äòmy behavioral rule‚Äô: fake Adobe Flash installer, lots of PUAs from subdomain name \[cdn, dl, api\] and Vietnamese developer certificate ID.

Please note that VT score is an indicator only, people usually fail to judge hardworking AVs by looking at VT score. We can never know if AV would detect those adwares live running whether or not. Also instead of Mughthesec, other adware use different loader names such as SearchWebSvc, TrustedSafeFinder, etc. I don‚Äôt think OSX/Mughthesec would be appropriate for the adware name. I suggest it would be OperatorMac because all campaign packages call a simple loader ‚Äúmac‚Äù binary.

**Conclusion**

Be **vigilant**, no one needs Flash nowadays it‚Äôs dead. Apple Mac is not virus-free even with those fancy Apple protection XProtect, GateKeeper, Mac sandbox, code signing, etc, many security researchers already warned.

It‚Äôs likely an affiliation advertising campaign, in which adware authors spent quite some money (~$800) for these 8 Apple developer certificates and only 2 of them are revoked. Some of dropped MachO executables are not signed, and we don‚Äôt know what if those can be really dangerous (like the unsigned MachO executable from APT32 Ocean Lotus campaign targeted Vietnamese organizations lately is really a sophisticated one). Based on timeline and periods of certificate registration, and money they have spent, I doubt these adware creators are making lots of money. Last, let me remind you some incidents happened recently and could be related to this campaign:

* [Malicious browser extension ‚Äì fake IDM Downloader harvested around 5M cookies from popular websites, targeted Vietnamese netizens.](http://genk.vn/chuyen-gia-bao-mat-phat-hien-duong-day-chiem-doat-tai-khoan-ngan-hang-facebook-gmail-cuc-lon-o-viet-nam-ban-cung-co-the-la-nan-nhan-20170622230143671.chn)

**P/S:** I confronted one famous hacker in cyber pirate community ‚Äì ‚ÄúQuoc Thinh‚Äù aka G4mm4, he seriously admitted he's behind the "crime". Not sure that‚Äôs true or he was just kidding :)
