<!-- For now, this page is assumed to be a static description of your courses. You can convert it to a collection similar to `_projects/` so that you can have a dedicated page for each course.

Organize your courses by years, topics, or universities, however you like! -->

**Write me an email and send your cv if you are interested. I am always interested in working with students (either in hobby project or interns/thesis). Contact me with a specific proposal and make sure you have at least skipped some of my work.**
