Microsoft OneNote has surprisingly emerged as a new vector for delivering sophisticated malware. In this presentation, I will discuss how the infamous Qakbot malware operation has evolved to exploit OneNote documents for covert distribution and evasion.

Multiple malware campaigns that use specially crafted OneNote files to distribute malware payloads will be investigated in depth. I will reveal the key technical details behind recent campaigns that use specially crafted OneNote files to bypass defenses, such as encryption, obfuscation, and process injection techniques. We will investigate the infection chain and unpacking techniques used to covertly deliver the Qakbot payload.

I will demonstrate through case studies how the threat actors behind Qakbot continue to innovate their social engineering and technical tactics. I'll also discuss how other sophisticated malware operations, such as IcedID, ASyncRAT, etc., have adopted similar OneNote techniques.

This presentation will equip developers and security engineers with the knowledge necessary to detect and defend against this fresh breed of highly evasive malware attacks. I will outline specific recommendations for detecting OneNote malware based on behavioral analytics and industry standards. By showcasing OneNote's emerging role in sophisticated cybercrime operations, we can close this new attack vector and protect our users, customers, and organizations.
